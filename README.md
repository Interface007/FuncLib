# FuncLib
Just a little library to have fun coding ... solutions searching for problems ;-)

Should I use it for production? 
Definitely no - this is just a fun project, so it will not be maintained in any way.

Can I copy and paste code from it? 
Yes, if you want to.

Why did you wrote it? 
Simply because of boring travel time ;-)
